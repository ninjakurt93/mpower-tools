# About
This adds MQTT features to Ubiquiti Networks mPower devices.
This is version 2, which aims to comply with [homie MQTT convention](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie). The implementation of the convention is not complete yet.

# Warning
Use at your own risk!

# Installation

**Attention! Automated installation using the script below is broken at the moment. You need to copy files manually**

(Reason is most likely because the mpower firmware/wget does not support newer TLS/SLL protocols required by github.)

Alternatively is to use an intermediate web server.
And in the install-client.sh change the host to your ip for said web server. (You can use your own pc as well.) 

Use a SSH client and connect to your mPower device.
Internet access is required to use the automated installation process. If you don't have internet access you need to perform all steps of [install-client.sh](https://github.com/magcode/mpower-tools/blob/master/mqtt/client/install-client.sh) manually.

Enter the following commands

```
mkdir /var/etc/persistent/mqtt
wget --no-check-certificate -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magcode/mpower-tools/master/mqtt/client/install-client.sh -O /var/etc/persistent/mqtt/install-client.sh;chmod 755 /var/etc/persistent/mqtt/install-client.sh;/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/install-client.sh

save
reboot
```

# Starting
```
/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client/mqrun.sh
```
The script also starts automatically approx 3 minutes after booting the device (using rc.poststart).

# Stoping
```
/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client/mqstop.sh
```

# Configuration
## MQTT
Edit the file `/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client/mqtt.cfg` and configure your server, topic and refresh time. Setting topic, refresh, mqttusername and mqttpassword is not mandatory. Defaults are 
`topic=homie/[name of the mpower]` and `refresh=60` seconds

```
mqtthost=192.168.0.1
#refresh=60
#topic=my/topic
#mqttusername=myMqttUserName
#mqttpassword=myMqttPassword
```
## Configuring transmitted node attributes
You can suppress certain attributes (such as voltage) by editing the file `mpower-pub.cfg`. Set value to `0` if you dont need the data.

```
#enable (1) or disable (0) properties here
relay=1
power=1
energy=1
lock=1
voltage=0
```

## LED
You can configure the LED using the file `led.cfg`.

```
# set the led state using this configuration, none of the settings mandatory!
# afterboot ... led state after starting
# relay_off ... led state when all relays are OFF
# relay_on  ... led state if at least one relay is ON
# 0=OFF, 1=BLUE, 2=YELLOW, 3=PURPLE

afterboot=3
# relay_on=1
# relay_off=0
```

# Published data

The mPower device will publish messages every 60 seconds to different topics. Example:

```
homie/mpower-1/port1/relay=0
homie/mpower-1/port2/relay=1
homie/mpower-1/port3/relay=0
homie/mpower-1/port1/power=0.0
homie/mpower-1/port2/power=7.2
homie/mpower-1/port3/power=0.0
homie/mpower-1/port1/energy=0
homie/mpower-1/port2/energy=4
homie/mpower-1/port3/energy=8
homie/mpower-1/port1/voltage=0.0
homie/mpower-1/port2/voltage=234.9
homie/mpower-1/port3/voltage=0.0
```

Additionally - currently only at the start of the script - the device will also report:

```
homie/mpower-1/$homie=2.1.0
homie/mpower-1/$name=mpower-1
homie/mpower-1/$fw/version=MF.v2.1.11-mq-0.2
homie/mpower-1/$fw/name=mPower=MQTT
homie/mpower-1/$localip=192.168.1.26
homie/mpower-1/$nodes=port1,port2,port3
homie/mpower-1/$stats/uptime=2589629.67
homie/mpower-1/port1/relay/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port2/relay/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port3/relay/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port1/lock/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port2/lock/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port3/lock/$settable=true
```

# Control sockets via MQTT
You can control the sockets by sending `0` or `1` to the topic `<topic chosen above>/port<number of socket>/relay/set`

You can lock the sockets by sending `0` or `1` to the topic `<topic chosen above>/port<number of socket>/lock/set`

# logfile
The tool logs into standard messages log.
```
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

# Integrating into openHAB

This is an example how to define an openHAB thing:

```
Thing mqtt:topic:switchTV "Switch TV" (mqtt:broker:mosquitto) {
    Channels:
        Type switch : switch "Switch" [ stateTopic="homie/mympower/port4/relay", on="1", off="0", commandTopic="homie/mympower/port4/relay/set"]
        Type number : consumption "Consumption" [ stateTopic="homie/mympower/port4/energy"] 
        Type number : power "Power" [ stateTopic="homie/mympower/port4/power"] 
}
```
and the according items:
```
Switch switchWZTV "Switch TV" { channel="mqtt:topic:switchTV:switch"}
Number switchWZTVEnergy "Switch TV Energy [%d Wh]" { channel="mqtt:topic:switchTV:consumption"}
Number switchWZTVPower "Switch TV Power [%.1f W]"  { channel="mqtt:topic:switchTV:power"}
```
